# Description:

    The program Name Data Viewer uses object(s) created from the Name class. This program fetches name data from a
a Microsoft SQL Server database server and prints out the results to the screen.

    The Name class is stored in a module named Name (Name.py). This code use object(s) from the Database class to define
a static method. This code defines a constructor that stores values for name, year, gender, and count for the object.
This code also has setters and getters for the 4 properties above. Then,it defines a static method called readName()
which call Database.readName() and return its results.

    The Database class is stored in a module named Database (Database.py). This code defines two class method called
readNames() and connect().
        - The method connect() makes a connection to the NAMES database.
        - The readNames() fetch name data from the Database based on filtered criteria. This method calls cls.connect()
        and takes two parameters: gender, and year which are used to filter the results. It contains the SQL query where
        the  two parameters are passed to the WHERE clause(use parameter binding. When called, the method return a list
        of Name objects that match the criteria.

    The main (main.py) contains the main code of the program. This code imports the Name class from the Name module.
    The main code asks user to enter value for the search criteria and use the readNames() method from Name module to
    fetch the matching Name objects. Then, it should write those objects to the console.

   The program need to validate user inputs. Gender should be restricted to M or F, Year should be a whole number
   between 1915 and 2014, Name should be non-empty, and NameCount should be a whole number between 5 and 200,000.

   Example:

    Select a year between 1915 and 2014: x
    Please enter a whole number!
    Select a year between 1915 and 2014: 1900
    The year must be between 1915 and 2014!
    Select a year between 1915 and 2014: 1962
    Please enter a gender (M/F): x
    Please type M or F!
    Please enter a gender (M/F): M
